# welcome to my myspace blog

I'm Jean! I'm a developer from the Greater Seattle Area and a graduate of Computer Science from Rochester Instutitue of Technology. 

I love Rust, Svelte, Python, data science, and all sorts of fun stuff. You can check me out on **[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jeanmachine.dev)** for my social media presence, it's where I'm most active. I'm involved in AT Protocol dev spaces, and I'm also a big fan of public transportation, biking, coffee.
